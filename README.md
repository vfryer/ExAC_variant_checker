# ExAC_variant_checker
This repository holds two scripts, one for parsing HGVS coding DNA nomenclature and another for retrieving genomic co-ordiantes and ExAC details for any variants found in ExAC.

Files include test_variants.csv (a .csv containing a variety and real and fictional variants created to test the limits of the scripts) and the output of the cDNA_parser.py program (filename_parser_output.csv) and the output file of the ExAC_variant_checker.py program (filename_exac_capture.csv)
